### Intro
Our project is designed to be a daily challenge online for people to produce a drawing, given the prompt for the day and a time limit. The prompt will be assigned randomly at a set time every day to allow people to attempt the challenge when they are free to do so, allowing users to express themselves among a group in which they feel comfortable and get feedback effortlessly. Prompts will be random every day, from things like “boat” to things like “axolotl”, with the exception of yearly holidays and events where we will include seasonal prompts to celebrate
the festivities. Once you have done your drawing for the day, you can go and see the drawings that your friends have done today, alongside being able to rate them with our star system.

After you’ve seen the pieces of art that your friends have done, you can visit your friends page and see your friends’ accounts, including their name, profile drawing, favourite drawing (which they can set via the memories page), and the badges they’ve unlocked; you could even make
badge-earning a race against friends; it’s a great way to challenge them! Click on their badges to see more information about those that they have earned, and how you can earn them too. Also, you’re able to view the entire collection of each friend’s drawings so you can explore their creative mind; you can do the same for your own pictures from the memories page, which displays your complete works in order, from most recent, in a nice gallery view.

To cater to our future users, we have added multiple features to help make our web app more accessible. A very commonly desired feature is our dark mode option to reduce the blue light emitted from the screen, which is better for health. Also, for people with sight loss, we have
options for larger text and sound prompts to help them to navigate and enjoy the app; likewise, brushes and other drawing tools will, by default, have different sizes meaning that people are
able to select a larger brush size to help them see what they are drawing. With the options for multiple languages, we can reach people from different countries and cultures to come together and join the fun of drawing, sharing their creativity across the globe without having to know English.

Our users also made it clear that having the app be a quick and simple process was very important, so the introduction of difficulty allowed us to give people the freedom of how long they wish to spend on their drawing, and the difficulty they select will be displayed along with their drawing so that users can take the difficulty into account whilst ranking drawings. People have also suggested that we have a wider range of tools available to draw with, so that they aren’t limited by our web-app. They have been transparent about wanting to be able to interact with other users' posts and to be able to do so quickly, which has further justified the use of the ‘Star’ ranking system so that people can have quick and comparable data based on what they have created and shared.
